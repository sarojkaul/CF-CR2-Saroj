                <p>Your company’s website is the most significant marketing tool you have. It is accessible by almost everybody in the world, which means that you should make sure that you have the most polished marketing plan possible when you launch or revise it. Individuals who may also be interested in a career at your company also rely on the website as an example, which means that you should emphasize your company culture online. Here are a few ways to do that.</p>
            </div>
            <br /><h1>General Tone</h1><br />
            <p>Is your company one that prefers formal professionalism or which can get away with a more casual tone? Whether you want them to or not, simple things like word choice and image composition can make a huge difference when it comes to the way people perceive your company. A more formal model should rely on traditional web design sensibilities, including the use of simple text, conservative images, and a web template that matches the most commonly used business templates from around the Internet. A company that wants a more casual culture can focus on breezier text and a less formal style. This choice will interest some people and turn others off, regardless of what you choose.</p>
            <br /><h1>Employee Profiles</h1><br />
            <p>
             Your business is nothing without your employees, and you should consider profiling those who are most integral to your organization. Your employee profiles can tell people many important things about your company culture. Depending on the way you present them, you can make yourself seem as professional or personable as you want. The choice of who you profile demonstrates which people are most integral to your business. Even something as simple as job titles can say something about who you are and what your company represents. If the “About Us” section of a website is the skeleton of your company, the employee profiles serve to fill that skeleton in, making up the main part of your company culture.
             Your website says a lot about you as a business. Some of that is intentional, while some of it is unintentional. Regardless of how tightly you control your web content, though, you should keep the above areas in mind. These three parts of a company website tell about the culture of that specific business, and that in turn influences not only your customers’ reactions, but also the reactions of current and future employees, investors, and members of the general public.
